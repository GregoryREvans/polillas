The \textit{polillas} is a shapeshifting magician, commonly taking the form of a Jaguar. While some native North American cultures have mythology surrounding the transmutation from human to animal, evidence suggests that this Mesoamerican analog to the European werewolf was, in fact, a cultural import, although this is contested. The polillas may exhibit traits of either good or evil and is sometimes used as a generic term for ``wizard.'' Carlos Castaneda, whose work is regarded as primarily fictional, defines the polillas as ``the teacher who becomes the gateway, the doorway, the intermediate between the world of the `seeker' or apprentice, and the world of the spirit.''

\pmb{Tempi} : Nearly all tempi in the score are related to one another by metric modulation. It is not the case that every modulation is prepared by the rhythmic key written in the modulation symbol. Rarely are continuous, equidistant beats presented across the modulation boundaries. When the resultant tempo of a modulation is prepared in the preceding section, it is highlighted by the use of a \textit{hauptstimme} bracket. The intention of this notation is not to raise the dynamic level of these passages, but merely to draw attention to their location. Accelerandi and ritardandi are notated by arrows spanning between the starting and ending metronome marks.

\pmb{Repeats} : Two unusual repeats are given in the score: one overlapping repeat and one nested repeat. The units of these complex repeats are distinguished by the color of the repeat-bar symbol.

\pmb{Accidentals} : After temporary accidentals, cancellation marks are printed also in the following measure (for notes in the same octave) and, in the same measure, for notes in other octaves, but they are printed again if the same note appears later in the same measure, except if the note is immediately repeated.
